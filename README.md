# MARIE Code Examples

## Context
I developed these MARIE codes as a college assignment. I decided to make this repository public because there aren't many examples of MARIE code available (Exponential, Factorial, and Bubble Sort). Feel free to use the code in your projects, assignments, studies, etc. However, be cautious of plagiarism.

## Algorithms

### Exponential code MARIE
This algorithm takes two input numbers and performs the exponential calculation correctly. I haven't tested to see the limits of the calculations. Note that the result for any number raised to the power of 0 is not functioning correctly, so you will need to make that adjustment. Other than that, it works fine.

### Factorial code MARIE
This algorithm supports numbers from 1 to 7 and handles the special case of the number 0. It is my most complete code and works correctly.
